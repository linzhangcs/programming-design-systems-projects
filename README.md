# About this repository

This is Lin's repo for following [Printing Code](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/) class. This will also help me to learn [Rune.js](http://runemadsen.github.io/rune.js/) and explore the idea of [design systems](http://runemadsen.com/blog/on-meta-design-and-algorithmic-design-systems/). Around cool stuff to learn! Thanks to [Rune Madsen](https://runemadsen.com/) for providing access to his class website online!
